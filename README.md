# bigdata-dashboard
Here you find a dashboard created with Dash and machine learning models (Spark and Dask).

For Spark you need to create a new envirement with python 3.7 otherwise it won't work.

To run the dashboard type in the terminal 'flask run'.

Furthermore, you have to install the different libraries that appear in the erros by using 'pip install'.
